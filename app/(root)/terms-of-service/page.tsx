        <h3>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements
          expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire
          agreement between you and us concerning the Services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or
          continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to
          assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal
          of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for
          any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the
          minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will
          continue in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or
          otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign or
          transfer these Terms, at our sole discretion, without restriction.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or
          delay in performance of, any of our obligations under these Terms that
          is caused by events outside our reasonable control.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms is intended to, or shall be deemed to,
          establish any partnership or joint venture between you and us,
          constitute either of us as the agent of the other, or authorise either
          of us to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of the
          other.
